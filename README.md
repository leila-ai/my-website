# my-website
A website I designed for myself at the early stages of my learning process as a web developer.
This project is still in progress and I have yet to finish it. But this is the initial design.

•	CSS is written using SASS. No Bootstrap (or any other CSS frameworks) has been used.
•	I have used both pure JS and jQuery.
•	The form is submitted via PHP. 

Any recommendations and feedbacks are welcome.
