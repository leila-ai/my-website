# my-website
A website I designed for myself at the early stages of my learning process as a web developer 

www.leilaahmadi.com

I learn best by doing projects. Once I learned HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, I decided to implement and practice what I have learnt on a personal website, before proceeding further. I chose to design a personal webpage in roder to be more motivated. Initially, it was supposed to be a CV designed via the three skills I have learnt. I changed my design and concept four times, until I finally came up with this idea and design.

This project is still in progress and I have yet to finish it. But this is the initial design of this version of my website.

I would appreciate any recommendations and feedabcks on it.

This is pure CSS I have written usign SASS. No Bootstrap or any other CSS frameworks has been used.
I have used both pure JS and jQuery.
The form is submitted via PHP.
